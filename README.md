# BLAD-eLLM: Blockchain Live Anomaly Detection with eBPF and LLMs
BLAD-eLLM is an framework for real-time anomaly detection in blockchain systems, integrating extended Berkeley Packet Filter(eBPF) technology and Large Language Models (LLMs). This repository contains the implementation of our novel approach for monitoring, detecting, and mitigating malicious activities in blockchain networks.

Note: This initial release contains a part of components of the anomaly detection framework. The complete implementation with full optimizations will be released in the future as part of our research publication.
